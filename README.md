# Alewife

## What is it?

a self-hosted micro-website with social network features.

## How does it work?

run one script and get your own website which fits into the free-usage tier of supported hosting providers (which means no initial cost to you).

post, share, and follow your friends and acquaintances like any other social network, but without the Big-Tech ads and privacy invasion.

## How do I get it?

Alewife is still in its very early stages and its setup instructions currently assume a certain level of technical know-how (hopefully this will be changing in the very near future).  but for right now:

1. install Docker and git
2. sign up with a supported hosting provider
  - fly.io
3. create and save an API or access token for your hosting provider
4. clone this repository
5. run `./installer/linux/setup.sh`
