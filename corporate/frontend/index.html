      <h2>How does it really work?</h2>
      <p>Existing big-name social media either makes everyone log into the same website (like Facebook or Twitter) or makes you link together a handful of sorta-kinda related websites (like Mastodon).  But with Alewife, every user runs their own self-contained website:  everyone has their own messages and photos, and connections stored in their own private secure database.  Our software connects all the dots for you without giving us any more information than you want to.</p>
      <p>The advantages are obvious.  There's no big corporation turning you into anonymized datapoint in order to squeeze more engagement out of you and dollars out of advertisers.</p>
      <p>There are disadvantages too!  Running your own website means, well, running your own website.  You sometimes have to worry about tech-y things like bandwidth usage and storage quotas.  It sounds a little scary, but we've built some high-quality tools to do the work for you.  And many hosting providers offer free or low-cost usage tiers which should allow you to run an Alewife node and connect with a few hundred of your friends for no more than a few bucks each month.</p>
      <p>We're betting that the advantages to our approach are great enough, and that we've made the hard stuff made easy enough, that you're going to want to join us to take control of your online life.</p>
